\usage{
create_agent(
  tbl,
  name = NULL,
  actions = NULL,
  end_fns = NULL,
  embed_report = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl}{The input table. This can be a data frame, a tibble, or a
\code{tbl_dbi} object.}

\item{name}{An optional name for the validation plan that the agent will
eventually carry out during the interrogation process. If no value is
provided, a name will be generated based on the current system time.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that all validation
steps can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be
created with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function. Should an action levels
list be used for specific validation step, any default set here will be
overridden.}

\item{end_fns}{A list of functions that should be performed at the end of an
interrogation.}

\item{embed_report}{An option to embed a \strong{gt}-based validation report into
the \code{ptblank_agent} object. If \code{FALSE} (the default) then the table object
will be not generated and available with the agent upon returning from the
interrogation.}
}
\value{
A \code{ptblank_agent} object.

\description{
Creates an \emph{agent} object, which is used in a \emph{data quality reporting}
workflow. The overall aim of this workflow is to generate some reporting on
the state of data quality for a target table. We can supply as many
validation step functions as the user wishes to write to get validation
coverage on that table. We supply a single table to \code{create_agent()}, which
becomes the sole focus of the data quality analysis. After application of
one or more validation step functions, we need to use the \code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}}
function to complete the process; the validation step functions, when called
on an agent, are merely instructions up to that point. The \emph{agent} then has
information on how the interrogation went. Reporting of the interrogation can
be performed with the \code{\link[=get_agent_report]{get_agent_report()}} function. If we just need to know
whether all validations completely passed (i.e., all steps had no failing
test units), the \code{\link[=all_passed]{all_passed()}} function should be used.

\examples{
library(dplyr)

# Create a simple table with a
# column of numerical values
tbl <- tibble(a = c(5, 7, 8, 7))

# Create a pointblank `agent` object
agent <- create_agent(tbl = tbl)

# Then, as with any `ptblank_agent`
# object, we can add validation steps
# to the validation plan and then
# eventually use `interrogate()`
# to perform the validations; here,
# with a single validation step, we
# expect that values in column `a`
# are always greater than 4
agent <-
  agent \%>\%
  col_vals_gt(vars(a), 4) \%>\%
  interrogate()
 
# Get a tibble-based report from the
# agent by using `get_agent_report()`
agent \%>\%
  get_agent_report(display_table = FALSE)
