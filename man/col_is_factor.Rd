\usage{
col_is_factor(x, columns, actions = NULL, brief = NULL, active = TRUE)

expect_col_is_factor(object, columns, threshold = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble, or an agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.
This is to be used as the main input for a validation step function.}

\item{columns}{The column (or a set of columns, provided as a character
vector) to which this validation should be applied.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}

\item{active}{A logical value indicating whether the validation step should
be active. If the step function is working with an agent, \code{FALSE} will make
the validation step inactive (still reporting its presence and keeping
indexes for the steps unchanged). If the step function will be operating
directly on data, then any step with \code{active = FALSE} will simply pass the
data through with no validation whatsoever. The default for this is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{object}{A data frame or a tibble. This is to be used expressly as input
for a testthat expectation function (which are all in the form
\verb{expect_*()}).}

\item{threshold}{A simple failure threshold value for use with the testthat
expectation function. By default, this is set to \code{1} meaning that any
single unit of failure in data validation results in an overall test
failure. Whole numbers beyond \code{1} indicate that any failing units up to
that absolute threshold value will result in a succeeding testthat test.
Likewise, fractional values (between \code{0} and \code{1}) act as a proportional
failure threshold.}
}
\value{
For the validation step function, the return value is either a
\code{ptblank_agent} object or a table object (depending on whether an agent
object or a table was passed to \code{x}). The expectation function invisibly
returns its input but, in the context of testing data, the function is
called primarily for its potential side-effects (e.g., signaling failure).
}
\description{
The \code{col_is_factor()} validation step function checks whether one or more
columns is of the factor type. Like many of the \verb{col_is_*()}-type functions
in \strong{pointblank}, the only requirement is a specification of the column
names. This function can be used directly on a data table or with an \emph{agent}
object (technically, a \code{ptblank_agent} object). Each validation step will
operate over a single test unit, which is whether the column is a factor-type
column or not.
}
\details{
If providing multiple column names, the result will be an expansion of
validation steps to that number of column names (e.g., \code{vars(col_a, col_b)}
will result in the entry of two validation steps). Aside from column names
in quotes and in \code{vars()}, \strong{tidyselect} helper functions are available for
specifying columns. They are: \code{starts_with()}, \code{ends_with()}, \code{contains()},
\code{matches()}, and \code{everything()}.

Often, we will want to specify \code{actions} for the validation. This argument,
present in every validation step function, takes a specially-crafted list
object that is best produced by the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} function. Read that
function's documentation for the lowdown on how to create reactions to
above-threshold failure levels in validation. The basic gist is that you'll
want at least a single threshold level (specified as either the fraction test
units failed, or, an absolute value), often using the \code{warn_at} argument.
This is especially true when \code{x} is a table object because, otherwise,
nothing happens. For the \verb{col_is_*()}-type functions, using
\code{action_levels(warn_at = 1)} or \code{action_levels(stop_at = 1)} are good choices
depending on the situation (the first produces a warning, the other
\code{stop()}s).

Want to describe this validation step in some detail? Keep in mind that this
is only useful if \code{x} is an \emph{agent}. If that's the case, \code{brief} the agent
with some text that fits. Don't worry if you don't want to do it. The
\emph{autobrief} protocol is kicked in when \code{brief = NULL} and a simple brief will
then be automatically generated.
