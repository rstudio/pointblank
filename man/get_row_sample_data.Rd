\title{Get non-passing sample rows from a validation step}
\usage{
get_row_sample_data(agent, step)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{an agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}. It should have
had \code{\link{interrogate}()} called on it, such that the validation
steps were carried out and any sample rows from non-passing validations
could potentially be available in the object.}

\item{step}{the validation step number, which is assigned to each validation
step in the order of definition. To determine which validation steps
produced sample row data, one can use the
\code{\link{get_row_sample_info}()} function. The data frame output
provides the step number and the number of rows in the sample.}
}
\description{
Get row data that didn't pass a validation step. The amount of row data
available depends on both the fraction of rows that didn't pass a validation
step and the level of sampling or explicit collection from that set of rows
(this is defined within the \code{\link{interrogate}()} call).
