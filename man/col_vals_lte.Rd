\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble (\code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_dbi}), or, an agent object of
class \code{ptblank_agent} that can be created with \code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}}.}

\item{columns}{The column (or a set of columns, provided as a character
vector) to which this validation should be applied.}

\item{value}{A numeric value used for this test. Any column values \verb{<= value}
are considered passing.}

\item{na_pass}{Should any encountered \code{NA} values be allowed to pass a
validation unit? This is by default \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to give \code{NA}s
a pass.}

\item{preconditions}{expressions used for mutating the input table before
proceeding with the validation. This is ideally as a one-sided R formula
using a leading \code{~}. In the formula representation, the \code{.} serves as the
input data table to be transformed (e.g.,
\code{~ . \%>\% dplyr::mutate(col = col + 10)}.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}

\item{active}{A logical value indicating whether the validation step should
be active. If the step function is working with an agent, \code{FALSE} will make
the validation step inactive (still reporting its presence and keeping
indexes for the steps unchanged). If the step function will be operating
directly on data, then any step with \code{active = FALSE} will simply pass the
data through with no validation whatsoever. The default for this is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{object}{A data frame or tibble (\code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_dbi}) that serves as
the target table for the expectation function.}

\item{threshold}{A simple failure threshold value for use with the
expectation function. By default, this is set to \code{1} meaning that any
single unit of failure in data validation results in an overall test
failure. Whole numbers beyond \code{1} indicate that any failing units up to
that absolute threshold value will result in a succeeding \strong{testthat}
test. Likewise, fractional values (between \code{0} and \code{1}) act as a
proportional failure threshold.}
}
\value{
For the validation step function, the return value is either a
\code{ptblank_agent} object or a table object (depending on whether an agent
object or a table was passed to \code{x}). The expectation function invisibly
returns its input but, in the context of testing data, the function is
called primarily for its potential side-effects (e.g., signaling failure).
}
\description{
The \code{col_vals_lte()} validation step function and the \code{expect_col_vals_lte()}
expectation function both check whether column values in a table are \emph{less
than or equal to} a specified \code{value} (the exact comparison used in this
function is \code{col_val <= value}). The \code{value} can be specified as a single,
literal value or as a column name given in \code{vars()}. The validation step
function can be used directly on a data table or with an \emph{agent} object
(technically, a \code{ptblank_agent} object) whereas the expectation function can
only be used with a data table. The types of data tables that can be used
include data frames, tibbles, and even database tables of \code{tbl_dbi} class.
Each validation step or expectation will operate over the number of test
units that is equal to the number of rows in the table (after any
\code{preconditions} have been applied).
}
\details{
If providing multiple column names to \code{columns}, the result will be an
expansion of validation steps to that number of column names (e.g.,
\code{vars(col_a, col_b)} will result in the entry of two validation steps). Aside
from column names in quotes and in \code{vars()}, \strong{tidyselect} helper functions
are available for specifying columns. They are: \code{starts_with()},
\code{ends_with()}, \code{contains()}, \code{matches()}, and \code{everything()}.

This validation step function supports special handling of \code{NA} values. The
\code{na_pass} argument will determine whether an \code{NA} value appearing in a test
unit should be counted as a \emph{pass} or a \emph{fail}. The default of
\code{na_pass = FALSE} means that any \code{NA}s encountered will accumulate failing
test units.

Having table \code{preconditions} means \strong{pointblank} will mutate the table just
before interrogation. Such a table mutation is isolated in scope to the
validation step(s) produced by the validation step function call. Using
\strong{dplyr} code is suggested here since the statements can be translated to
SQL if necessary. The code is most easily supplied as a one-sided \strong{R}
formula (using a leading \code{~}). In the formula representation, the \code{.} serves
as the input data table to be transformed (e.g.,
\code{~ . \%>\% dplyr::mutate(col_a = col_b + 10)}). Alternatively, a function could
instead be supplied (e.g.,
\code{function(x) dplyr::mutate(x, col_a = col_b + 10)}).

Often, we will want to specify \code{actions} for the validation. This argument,
present in every validation step function, takes a specially-crafted list
object that is best produced by the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} function. Read that
function's documentation for the lowdown on how to create reactions to
above-threshold failure levels in validation. The basic gist is that you'll
want at least a single threshold level (specified as either the fraction test
units failed, or, an absolute value), often using the \code{warn_at} argument.
This is especially true when \code{x} is a table object because, otherwise,
nothing happens. For the \verb{col_vals_*()}-type functions, using
\code{action_levels(warn_at = 0.25)} or \code{action_levels(stop_at = 0.25)} are good
choices depending on the situation (the first produces a warning when a
quarter of the total test units fails, the other \code{stop()}s at the same
threshold level).

Want to describe this validation step in some detail? Keep in mind that this
is only useful if \code{x} is an \emph{agent}. If that's the case, \code{brief} the agent
with some text that fits. Don't worry if you don't want to do it. The
\emph{autobrief} protocol is kicked in when \code{brief = NULL} and a simple brief will
then be automatically generated.
