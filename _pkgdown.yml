  - title: Planning and Prep
    desc: >
      Should you need to understand your data a bit more, use the `scan_data()`
      function. It provides a comprehensive report on the data you might be
      planning on validating. If going down the road of preparing a data quality
      analysis, call on an *agent* to carry out that eventual plan with
      `create_agent()`. The agent here is to be told which table is the target,
      and, we devise a stepwise validation plan with validation step functions.

  - title: Validation Step, Expectation, and Test Functions
    desc: >
      Validation steps are either used with an **agent** object or, more simply,
      just with the table of interest. When used with an *agent*, each step
      function called works to build up a validation plan (which is executed
      with the `interrogate()` function). If used directly on data (that is, no
      agent is involved whatsoever), then the data is checked and passed
      through. However, if we (1) set `warn_*` and/or `stop_*` thresholds and
      (2) the level of failed validation units exceeds those set levels, then
      we'll get either a warning or a stop. Each validation step function is
      assoicated with an expectation function (of the form `expect_*()`). These
      expectation functions are equivalent in usage and behavior to those in
      the **testthat** package. Finallly, each validation function has an
      associated test function (of the form `test_*()`) which always returns a
      logical value.

  - title: Emailing
    desc: >
      Sometimes we want to email a report of a validation because of the
      importance of the information contained therein. The `email_blast()`
      function can be used within the `end_fns` argument of `create_agent()`,
      giving us options to send a customizable message only if specified
      conditions are met. To gain some practice with email customization, the
      `email_preview()` function is handy (it can be used directly on an
      `agent` object or an agent x-list object). The `stock_msg_body()` and
      `stock_msg_footer()` functions give us reasonable defaults for the HTML
      message itself, incorporating an emailable version of the validation
      report.

  - title: Interrogation
    desc: >
      If we have an **agent** object that has a plan (i.e., validation steps),
      the `interrogate()` function instructs the *agent* to interrogate the
      `tbl` data. The agent will go to work and also perform side-effect 
      functions at the step level and upon completion (if those are defined). 
    contents:
    - interrogate
    
  - title: Post-interrogation
    desc: >
      After interrogation with an agent, we can always get a report through its
      print method. However, we can get more options by using
      `get_agent_report()`. The agent always has a special list called an
      x-list. Access that by invoking the `get_agent_x_list()` and you'll then
      have a smorgasbord of information about how the validation went down.
      Table extracts are collected by default for failed rows (up to a limit)
      and we can access those with `get_data_extracts()`. Table rows can be
      sundered into 'pass' and 'fail' pieces. Access those table fragments with
      the `get_sundered_data()` function. Want to know if all validation steps
      have passed with flying colors? Sometimes that could happen; use the
      `all_passed()` function to find out.
