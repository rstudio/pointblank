\title{Read an agent from disk (redeployment)}
\usage{
agent_read(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path to the file that was previously written by
\code{\link[=agent_write]{agent_write()}}.}
}
\description{
An \emph{agent} that has been written to disk (with \code{\link[=agent_write]{agent_write()}}) can be read
back into memory with the \code{agent_read()} function. Once the \emph{agent} has been
read, it may not have a data table associated with it (depending on whether
the \code{keep_tbl} option was \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} when writing to disk) but it
should still be able to produce an agent report (by printing the agent to the
console or using \code{\link[=get_agent_report]{get_agent_report()}}), return an agent x-list (with
\code{\link[=get_agent_x_list]{get_agent_x_list()}}), and yield any available data extracts with
\code{\link[=get_data_extracts]{get_data_extracts()}}. Furthermore, all of its validation steps will still be
present (along with results from any interrogation).
}
\details{
Should the \emph{agent} possess a table-reading function (can be set any time with
\code{\link[=set_read_fn]{set_read_fn()}}) or a specific table (settable with \code{\link[=set_tbl]{set_tbl()}}) we could use
the \code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}} function again. This is useful for tables that evolve
over time and need periodic data quality assessments with the same validation
steps (and more steps can be added as well).
