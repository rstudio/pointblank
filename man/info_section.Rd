\description{
While the \code{\link[=info_tabular]{info_tabular()}} and \code{\link[=info_columns]{info_columns()}} functions allow us to
add/modify info text for specific sections, the \code{info_section()} makes it
possible to add sections of our own choosing and the information that make
sense for those sections. Define a \code{section_name} and provide a series of
named arguments (in the form \code{entry_name = "The *info text*."}) to build the
informational content for that section.
}
\section{Info Text}{

The \emph{info text} that's used for any of the \verb{info_*()} functions readily
accepts Markdown formatting, and, there are a few \emph{Text Tricks} that can be
used to spice up the presentation. Markdown links written as \verb{< link url >}
or \verb{[ link text ]( link url )} will get nicely-styled links. Any dates
expressed in the ISO-8601 standard with parentheses, \code{"(2004-12-01)"}, will
be styled with a font variation (monospaced) and underlined in purple. Spans
of text can be converted to label-style text by using: (1) double parentheses
around text for a rectangular border as in \verb{((label text))}, or (2) triple
parentheses around text for a rounded-rectangular border like \verb{(((label text)))}.

CSS style rules can be applied to spans of \emph{info text} with the following
form:

\verb{[[ info text ]]<< CSS style rules >>}

As an example of this in practice suppose you'd like to change the color of
some text to red and make the font appear somewhat thinner. A variation on
the following might be used:

\code{"This is a [[factor]]<<color: red; font-weight: 300;>> value."}

The are quite a few CSS style rules that can be used to great effect. Here
are a few you might like:
\itemize{
\item \verb{color: <a color value>;} (text color)
\item \verb{background-color: <a color value>;} (the text's background color)
\item \code{text-decoration: (overline | line-through | underline);}
\item \code{text-transform: (uppercase | lowercase | capitalize);}
\item \verb{letter-spacing: <a +/- length value>;}
\item \verb{word-spacing: <a +/- length value>;}
\item \code{font-style: (normal | italic | oblique);}
\item \code{font-weight: (normal | bold | 100-900);}
\item \code{font-variant: (normal | bold | 100-900);}
\item \verb{border: <a color value> <a length value> (solid | dashed | dotted);}
}

In the above examples, 'length value' refers to a CSS length which can be
expressed in different units of measure (e.g., \verb{12px}, \verb{1em}, etc.). Some
lengths can be expressed as positive or negative values (e.g., for
\code{letter-spacing}). Color values can be expressed in a few ways, the most
common being in the form of hexadecimal color values or as CSS color names.

\section{YAML}{

A \strong{pointblank} informant can be written to YAML with \code{\link[=yaml_write]{yaml_write()}} and the
resulting YAML can be used to regenerate an informant (with
\code{\link[=yaml_read_informant]{yaml_read_informant()}}) or perform the 'incorporate' action using the target
table (via \code{\link[=yaml_informant_incorporate]{yaml_informant_incorporate()}}). Extra sections (i.e., neither the
\code{table} nor the \code{columns} sections) can be generated and filled with \emph{info
text} by using one or more calls of \code{info_section()}. This is how it is
expressed in both R code and in the YAML representation.\preformatted{# R statement
informant \%>\% 
  info_section(
    section_name = "History",
    Changes = "
- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3",
    `Last Update` = "(2020-10-23) at 3:28 PM."
  ) \%>\%
  info_section(
    section_name = "Additional Notes",
    `Notes 1` = "Notes with a \{snippet\}.",
    `Notes 2` = "**Bold notes**."
  )

# YAML representation
History:
  Changes: |2-
  
    - Change 1
    - Change 2
    - Change 3
  Last Update: (2020-10-23) at 3:28 PM.
Additional Notes:
  Notes 1: Notes with a \{snippet\}.
  Notes 2: '**Bold notes**.'
}

Subsections represented as column names are automatically generated when
creating an informant. Within each of the top-level sections (i.e., \code{History}
and \verb{Additional Notes}) there can be multiple subsections used for holding
\emph{info text}.

It's safest to use single quotation marks around any \emph{info text} if directly
editing it in a YAML file. Note that Markdown formatting and \emph{info snippet}
placeholders (shown here as \code{{snippet}}, see \code{\link[=info_snippet]{info_snippet()}} for more
information) are preserved in the YAML. The Markdown to HTML conversion is
done when printing an informant (or invoking \code{\link[=get_informant_report]{get_informant_report()}} on an
\emph{informant}) and the processing of snippets (generation and insertion) is
done when using the \code{\link[=incorporate]{incorporate()}} function. Thus, the source text is always
maintained in the YAML representation and is never written in processed form.
