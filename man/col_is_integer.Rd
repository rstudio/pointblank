\usage{
col_is_integer(x, columns, actions = NULL, brief = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble, or an agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.}

\item{columns}{The column (or a set of columns, provided as a character
vector) to which this validation should be applied.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}
}
\value{
Either a \code{ptblank_agent} object or a table object, depending on what
was passed to \code{x}.
}
\description{
The \code{col_is_integer()} validation step function checks whether one or more
columns is of the integer type. Like many of the \verb{col_is_*()}-type functions
in \strong{pointblank}, the only requirement is a specification of the column
names. This function can be used directly on a data table or with an \emph{agent}
object (technically, a \code{ptblank_agent} object). Each validation step will
operate over a single test unit, which is whether the column is an
integer-type column or not.
}
\details{
If providing multiple column names, the result will be an expansion of
validation steps to that number of column names (e.g., \code{vars(col_a, col_b)}
will result in the entry of two validation steps). Aside from column names
in quotes and in \code{vars()}, \strong{tidyselect} helper functions are available for
specifying columns. They are: \code{starts_with()}, \code{ends_with()}, \code{contains()},
\code{matches()}, \code{one_of()}, and \code{everything()}.

Often, we will want to specify \code{actions} for the validation. This argument,
present in every validation step function, takes a specially-crafted list
object that is best produced by the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} function. Read that
function's documentation for the lowdown on how to create reactions to
above-threshold failure levels in validation. The basic gist is that you'll
want at least a single threshold level (specified as either the fraction test
units failed, or, an absolute value), often using the \code{warn_at} argument.
This is especially true when \code{x} is a table object because, otherwise,
nothing happens. For the \verb{col_is_*()}-type functions, using
\code{action_levels(warn_at = 1)} or \code{action_levels(stop_at = 1)} are good choices
depending on the situation (the first produces a warning, the other
\code{stop()}s).

Want to describe this validation step in some detail? Keep in mind that this
is only useful if \code{x} is an \emph{agent}. If that's the case, \code{brief} the agent
with some text that fits. Don't worry if you don't want to do it. The
\emph{autobrief} protocol is kicked in when \code{brief = NULL} and a simple brief will
then be automatically generated.

# Create a simple data frame
# with a column containing data
# classed as `integer`
df <-
  data.frame(
    a = as.integer(c(5, 9, 3))
  )

# Validate that column `a` in the
# data frame is an `integer`
agent <-
  create_agent(tbl = df) \%>\%
  col_is_integer(columns = vars(a)) \%>\%
  interrogate()

# Determine if these column
# validations have all passed
# by using `all_passed()`
