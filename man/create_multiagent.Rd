\title{Create a \strong{pointblank} \emph{multiagent} object}
\usage{
create_multiagent(..., lang = NULL, locale = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more \strong{pointblank} agent objects.}

\item{lang}{The language to use for any reporting that will be generated from
the \emph{multiagent}. (e.g., individual \emph{agent reports}, \emph{multiagent reports},
etc.). By default, \code{NULL} will create English (\code{"en"}) text. Other options
include French (\code{"fr"}), German (\code{"de"}), Italian (\code{"it"}), Spanish
(\code{"es"}), Portuguese (\code{"pt"}), Turkish (\code{"tr"}), Chinese (\code{"zh"}), Russian
(\code{"ru"}), Polish (\code{"pl"}), Danish (\code{"da"}), Swedish (\code{"sv"}), and Dutch
(\code{"nl"}).}

\item{locale}{An optional locale ID to use for formatting values in the
reporting outputs according the locale's rules. Examples include \code{"en_US"}
for English (United States) and \code{"fr_FR"} for French (France); more simply,
this can be a language identifier without a country designation, like "es"
for Spanish (Spain, same as \code{"es_ES"}).}
}
\value{
A \code{ptblank_multiagent} object.
}
\description{
Multiple \emph{agents} can be part of a single object called the \emph{multiagent}.
This can be useful when gathering multiple agents that have performed
interrogations in the past (perhaps saved to disk with \code{\link[=x_write_disk]{x_write_disk()}}).
When be part of a \emph{multiagent}, we can get a report that shows how data
quality evolved over time. This can be of interest when it's important to
monitor data quality and even the evolution of the validation plan itself.
The reporting table, generated by printing a \code{ptblank_multiagent} object or
by using the \code{\link[=get_multiagent_report]{get_multiagent_report()}} function, is, by default, organized by
the interrogation time and it automatically recognizes which validation steps
are equivalent across interrogations.
