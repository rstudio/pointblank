\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble, or an agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.}

\item{column}{The column (or a set of columns, provided as a character
vector) to which this validation should be applied. Aside from a single
column name, column operations can be used to create one or more computed
columns (e.g., \code{a + b} or \code{a + sum(a)}).}

\item{value}{A numeric value used for this test. Any column values \code{>= value} are considered passing.}

\item{preconditions}{An optional statement of filtering conditions that may
reduce the number of rows for validation for the current validation step.
The statements are executed for every row of the table in focus and are
often referred as predicate statements (they either return \code{TRUE} or
\code{FALSE} for every row evaluated, where rows evaluated as \code{TRUE} are the
rows that are retained for the validation step). For example, if a table
has columns \code{a}, \code{b}, and \code{c}, and, column \code{a} has numerical data, we can
write a statement \code{a < 5} that filters all rows in the table where values
in column a are less than five.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}

\item{warn_count}{The threshold number for individual
validations returning a \code{FALSE} result before applying the \code{warn} or
\code{notify} flag.}

\item{stop_count}{The threshold number or fraction of \code{FALSE}
validation results before stopping a simple validation or stopping an
agent-based validation.}

\item{notify_count}{The threshold number for individual
validations returning a \code{FALSE} result before applying the \code{warn} or
\code{notify} flag.}

\item{warn_fraction}{The threshold fraction for individual
validations returning a \code{FALSE} over all the entire set of individual
validations. Beyond this threshold, either the \code{warn} or \code{notify} flag will
be applied.}

\item{stop_fraction}{The threshold number or fraction of \code{FALSE}
validation results before stopping a simple validation or stopping an
agent-based validation.}

\item{notify_fraction}{The threshold fraction for individual
validations returning a \code{FALSE} over all the entire set of individual
validations. Beyond this threshold, either the \code{warn} or \code{notify} flag will
be applied.}

\item{tbl_name}{The name of the local or remote table.}

\item{db_type}{If the table is located in a database, the type of database is
required here. Currently, this can be either \code{PostgreSQL} or \code{MySQL}.}

\item{creds_file}{If a connection to a database is required for reaching the
table specified in \code{tbl_name}, then a path to a credentials file can be
used to establish that connection. The credentials file is an \code{RDS}
containing a character vector with the following items in the specified
order: (1) database name (\code{dbname}), (2) the \code{host} name, (3) the \code{port},
(4) the username (\code{user}), and (5) the \code{password}. This file can be easily
created using the \code{\link[=create_creds_file]{create_creds_file()}} function.}

\item{initial_sql}{When accessing a remote table, this provides an option to
provide an initial query component before conducting validations. An entire
SQL statement can be provided here, or, as a shortcut, the initial
\code{SELECT...} statement can be omitted for simple queries (e.g., \code{WHERE a > 1 AND b = 'one'}).}

\item{file_path}{An optional path for a tabular data file to be loaded for
this verification step. Valid types are CSV and TSV files.}

\item{col_types}{If validating a CSV or TSV file, an optional column
specification can be provided here as a string. This string representation
is where each character represents one column and the mappings are: \code{c} ->
character, \code{i} -> integer, \code{n} -> number, \code{d} -> double, \code{l} -> logical,
\code{D} -> date, \code{T} -> date time, \code{t} -> time, \code{?} -> guess, or \code{_/-}, which
skips the column.}
}
\value{
Either a \pkg{pointblank} agent object or a table object, depending
on what was passed to \code{x}.
}
\description{
Verification step where numeric values in a table column should be
greater than or equal to a specified value.

\examples{
# Create a simple data frame
# with a column of numerical
# values
df <-
  data.frame(
    a = c(5, 7, 6, 5, 8, 7))

# Validate that values in column
# `a` are always greater than or
# equal to 5
agent <-
  create_agent() \%>\%
  focus_on(tbl_name = "df") \%>\%
  col_vals_gte(
    column = a,
    value = 5) \%>\%
  interrogate()

# Determine if this column
# validation has passed by using
# `all_passed()`
all_passed(agent)
