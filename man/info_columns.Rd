\title{Add information that focuses on aspects of a data table's columns}
\usage{
info_columns(x, columns, ..., .add = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An informant object of class \code{ptblank_informant}.}

\item{columns}{The column or set of columns to focus on. Can be defined as a
column name in quotes (e.g., \code{"<column_name>"}), one or more column names
in \code{vars()} (e.g., \verb{vars(<column_name>)}), or with a select helper (e.g.,
\code{starts_with("date")}).}

\item{...}{Information entries as a series of named arguments. The names
refer to subsection titles within \code{COLUMN} -> \verb{<COLUMN_NAME>} and the RHS
contains the \emph{info text} (informational text that can be written as
Markdown and further styled with \emph{Text Tricks}).}

\item{.add}{Should new text be added to existing text? This is \code{TRUE} by
default; setting to \code{FALSE} replaces any existing text for a property.}
}
\value{
A \code{ptblank_informant} object.
}
\description{
Upon creation of an \emph{informant} object (with the \code{\link[=create_informant]{create_informant()}}
function), there are two sections containing properties: (1) 'table' and (2)
'columns'. The 'columns' section is initialized with the table's column names
and their types (as \verb{_type}). Beyond that, it is useful to provide details
about the nature of each column and we can do that with the \code{info_columns()}
function. A single column (or multiple columns) is targeted, and then a
series of named arguments (in the form \code{entry_name = "The *info text*."})
serves as additional information for the column or columns.
}
\details{
The \emph{info text} readily accepts Markdown formatting. Also, there are a few
\emph{Text Tricks} that are good to know. Markdown links written as \verb{< link url >}
or \verb{[ link text ]( link url )} will get nicely-styled links. Any dates
expressed in the ISO-8601 standard with parentheses, \code{"(2004-12-01)"}, will
be styled with a font variation (monospaced) and underlined in purple. Spans
of text can be converted to label text by using: (1) double parentheses
around text for a rectangular label as in \verb{((label text))}, or (2) triple
parentheses around text for a rounded-rectangular label like \verb{(((label text)))}. Finally, CSS styles can be applied to spans of \emph{info text} with
the following form:

\verb{[[ info text ]]<< CSS style rules >>}

As an example of this in practice suppose you'd like to change the color of
some text to red and make the font appear somewhat thinner. A variation on
the following might be used:

\code{"This is a [[factor]]<<color: red; font-weight: 300;>> value."}

\examples{
# Create a pointblank `informant`
# object with `create_informant()`;
# we specify a `read_fn` with the
# `~` followed by a statement that
# gets the `small_table` dataset
informant <- 
  create_informant(
    read_fn = ~ small_table,
    tbl_name = "small_table",
    label = "An example."
  )

# The `informant` object has the 'table'
# and 'columns' sections; we can add more
# properties to individual columns in
# the 'columns' section
informant <-
  informant \%>\%
  info_columns(
    columns = vars(a),
    info = "In the range of 1 to 10. (SIMPLE)"
  ) \%>\%
  info_columns(
    columns = starts_with("date"),
    info = "Time-based values (e.g., `Sys.time()`)."
  ) \%>\%
  info_columns(
    columns = "date",
    info = "The date part of `date_time`. (CALC)"
  )

# Upon printing the `informant` object, we see
# the additions made to the 'Columns' section

# The `informant` object can be written to
# a YAML file with the `yaml_write()`
# function; then, information can
# be directly edited or modified
# yaml_write(
#   informant = informant,
#   filename = "informant.yml"
# )

# The YAML file can then be read back
# into an informant object with the
# `yaml_read_informant()` function
# informant <-
#   yaml_read_informant(
#     filename = "informant.yml"
#   )
