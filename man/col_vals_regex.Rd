\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble (\code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_dbi}), Spark DataFrame
(\code{tbl_spark}), or, an agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent} that is created
with \code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}}.}

\item{columns}{The column (or a set of columns, provided as a character
vector) to which this validation should be applied.}

\item{regex}{A regular expression pattern to test for a match to the target
column. Any regex matches to values in the target \code{columns} will pass
validation.}

\item{na_pass}{Should any encountered \code{NA} values be considered as passing
test units? This is by default \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to give \code{NA}s
a pass.}

\item{preconditions}{An optional expression for mutating the input table
before proceeding with the validation. This is ideally as a one-sided R
formula using a leading \code{~}. In the formula representation, the \code{.} serves
as the input data table to be transformed (e.g.,
\code{~ . \%>\% dplyr::mutate(col = col + 10)}.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{step_id}{One or more optional identifiers for the single or multiple
validation steps generated from calling a validation function. The use of
step IDs serves to distinguish validation steps from each other and provide
an opportunity for supplying a more meaningful label compared to the step
index. By default this is \code{NULL}, and \strong{pointblank} will automatically
generate the step ID value (based on the step index) in this case. One or
more values can be provided, and the exact number of ID values should (1)
match the number of validation steps that the validation function call will
produce (influenced by the number of \code{columns} provided), (2) be an ID
string not used in any previous validation step, and (3) be a vector with
unique values.}

\item{label}{An optional label for the validation step. This label appears in
the agent report and for the best appearance it should be kept short.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step. If
nothing is provided here then an \emph{autobrief} is generated by the agent,
using the language provided in \code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}}'s \code{lang} argument (which
defaults to \code{"en"} or English). The \emph{autobrief} incorporates details of the
validation step so it's often the preferred option in most cases (where a
\code{label} might be better suited to succinctly describe the validation).}

\item{active}{A logical value indicating whether the validation step should
be active. If the step function is working with an agent, \code{FALSE} will make
the validation step inactive (still reporting its presence and keeping
indexes for the steps unchanged). If the step function will be operating
directly on data, then any step with \code{active = FALSE} will simply pass the
data through with no validation whatsoever. The default for this is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{object}{A data frame, tibble (\code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_dbi}), or Spark
DataFrame (\code{tbl_spark}) that serves as the target table for the expectation
function or the test function.}

\item{threshold}{A simple failure threshold value for use with the
expectation (\code{expect_}) and the test (\code{test_}) function variants. By
default, this is set to \code{1} meaning that any single unit of failure in data
validation results in an overall test failure. Whole numbers beyond \code{1}
indicate that any failing units up to that absolute threshold value will
result in a succeeding \strong{testthat} test or evaluate to \code{TRUE}. Likewise,
fractional values (between \code{0} and \code{1}) act as a proportional failure
threshold, where \code{0.15} means that 15 percent of failing test units results
in an overall test failure.}
}
\value{
For the validation function, the return value is either a
\code{ptblank_agent} object or a table object (depending on whether an agent
object or a table was passed to \code{x}). The expectation function invisibly
returns its input but, in the context of testing data, the function is
called primarily for its potential side-effects (e.g., signaling failure).
The test function returns a logical value.
}
\description{
The \code{col_vals_regex()} validation function, the \code{expect_col_vals_regex()}
expectation function, and the \code{test_col_vals_regex()} test function all check
whether column values in a table correspond to a \code{regex} matching expression.
The validation step function can be used directly on a data table or with an
\emph{agent} object (technically, a \code{ptblank_agent} object) whereas the
expectation and test functions can only be used with a data table. The types
of data tables that can be used include data frames, tibbles, database tables
(\code{tbl_dbi}), and Spark DataFrames (\code{tbl_spark}). Each validation step or
expectation will operate over the number of test units that is equal to the
number of rows in the table (after any \code{preconditions} have been applied).
}
\details{
If providing multiple column names, the result will be an expansion of
validation steps to that number of column names (e.g., \code{vars(col_a, col_b)}
will result in the entry of two validation steps). Aside from column names in
quotes and in \code{vars()}, \strong{tidyselect} helper functions are available for
specifying columns. They are: \code{starts_with()}, \code{ends_with()}, \code{contains()},
\code{matches()}, and \code{everything()}.

This validation function supports special handling of \code{NA} values. The
\code{na_pass} argument will determine whether an \code{NA} value appearing in a test
unit should be counted as a \emph{pass} or a \emph{fail}. The default of \code{na_pass = FALSE} means that any \code{NA}s encountered will accumulate failing test units.

Having table \code{preconditions} means \strong{pointblank} will mutate the table just
before interrogation. Such a table mutation is isolated in scope to the
validation step(s) produced by the validation function call. Using
\strong{dplyr} code is suggested here since the statements can be translated to
SQL if necessary. The code is most easily supplied as a one-sided \strong{R}
formula (using a leading \code{~}). In the formula representation, the \code{.} serves
as the input data table to be transformed (e.g.,
\code{~ . \%>\% dplyr::mutate(col_a = col_b + 10)}). Alternatively, a function could
instead be supplied (e.g.,
\code{function(x) dplyr::mutate(x, col_a = col_b + 10)}).

Often, we will want to specify \code{actions} for the validation. This argument,
present in every validation function, takes a specially-crafted list
object that is best produced by the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} function. Read that
function's documentation for the lowdown on how to create reactions to
above-threshold failure levels in validation. The basic gist is that you'll
want at least a single threshold level (specified as either the fraction of
test units failed, or, an absolute value), often using the \code{warn_at}
argument. This is especially true when \code{x} is a table object because,
otherwise, nothing happens. For the \verb{col_vals_*()}-type functions, using
\code{action_levels(warn_at = 0.25)} or \code{action_levels(stop_at = 0.25)} are good
choices depending on the situation (the first produces a warning when a
quarter of the total test units fails, the other \code{stop()}s at the same
threshold level).

Want to describe this validation step in some detail? Keep in mind that this
is only useful if \code{x} is an \emph{agent}. If that's the case, \code{brief} the agent
with some text that fits. Don't worry if you don't want to do it. The
\emph{autobrief} protocol is kicked in when \code{brief = NULL} and a simple brief will
then be automatically generated.

\examples{
# The `small_table` dataset in the
# package has a character-based `b`
# column with values that adhere to
# a very particular pattern; the
# following examples will validate
# that that column abides by a regex
# pattern
small_table

# This is the regex pattern that will
# be used throughout
pattern <- "[0-9]-[a-z]{3}-[0-9]{3}"

# A: Using an `agent` with validation
#    functions and then `interrogate()`

# Validate that all values in column
# `b` match the regex `pattern`
agent <-
  create_agent(small_table) \%>\%
  col_vals_regex(vars(b), pattern) \%>\%
  interrogate()
  
# Determine if this validation
# had no failing test units (there
# are 13 test units, one for each row)
all_passed(agent)

# Calling `agent` in the console
# prints the agent's report; but we
# can get a `gt_tbl` object directly
# with `get_agent_report(agent)`

# B: Using the validation function
#    directly on the data (no `agent`)

# This way of using validation functions
# acts as a data filter: data is passed
# through but should `stop()` if there
# is a single test unit failing; the
# behavior of side effects can be
# customized with the `actions` option
small_table \%>\%
  col_vals_regex(vars(b), pattern) \%>\%

# C: Using the expectation function

# With the `expect_*()` form, we would
# typically perform one validation at a
# time; this is primarily used in
# testthat tests
