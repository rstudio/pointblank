\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble (\code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_dbi}), or, an agent object of
class \code{ptblank_agent} that can be created with \code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}}.}

\item{schema}{A table schema of type \code{col_schema} which can be generated
using the \code{\link[=col_schema]{col_schema()}} function.}

\item{complete}{A requirement to account for all table columns in the
\code{schema}. By default, this is \code{TRUE} and so that all column names in the
target table must be present in the schema object. This restriction can be
relaxed by using \code{FALSE}, where we can provide a subset of table columns in
the schema.}

\item{in_order}{A stringent requirement for enforcing the order of columns in
the provided \code{schema}. By default, this is \code{TRUE} and the order of columns
in both the schema and the target table must match. By setting to \code{FALSE},
this strict order requirement is removed.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}

\item{active}{A logical value indicating whether the validation step should
be active. If the step function is working with an agent, \code{FALSE} will make
the validation step inactive (still reporting its presence and keeping
indexes for the steps unchanged). If the step function will be operating
directly on data, then any step with \code{active = FALSE} will simply pass the
data through with no validation whatsoever. The default for this is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{object}{A data frame or tibble (\code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_dbi}) that serves as
the target table for the expectation function.}

\item{threshold}{A simple failure threshold value for use with the
expectation function. By default, this is set to \code{1} meaning that any
single unit of failure in data validation results in an overall test
failure. Whole numbers beyond \code{1} indicate that any failing units up to
that absolute threshold value will result in a succeeding \strong{testthat}
test. Likewise, fractional values (between \code{0} and \code{1}) act as a
proportional failure threshold.}
}
\value{
For the validation function, the return value is either a
\code{ptblank_agent} object or a table object (depending on whether an agent
object or a table was passed to \code{x}). The expectation function invisibly
returns its input but, in the context of testing data, the function is
called primarily for its potential side-effects (e.g., signaling failure).
The test function returns a logical value.
}
\description{
The \code{col_schema_match()} validation function, the \code{expect_col_schema_match()}
expectation function, and the \code{test_col_schema_match()} test function all
work in conjunction with a \code{col_schema} object (generated through the
\code{\link[=col_schema]{col_schema()}} function) to determine whether the expected schema matches
that of the target table. The validation function can be used directly on a
data table or with an \emph{agent} object (technically, a \code{ptblank_agent} object)
whereas the expectation and test functions can only be used with a data
table. The types of data tables that can be used include data frames,
tibbles, and even database tables of \code{tbl_dbi} class. The validation step or
expectation operates over a single test unit, which is whether the schema
matches that of the table (within the constraints enforced by the \code{complete}
and \code{in_order} options). If the target table is a \code{tbl_dbi} object, we can
choose to validate the column schema that is based on R column types (e.g.,
\code{"numeric"}, \code{"character"}, etc.), or, SQL column types (e.g., \code{"double"},
\code{"varchar"}, etc.). That option is defined in the \code{\link[=col_schema]{col_schema()}} function (it
is the \code{.db_col_types} argument).
}
\details{
Often, we will want to specify \code{actions} for the validation. This argument,
present in every validation function, takes a specially-crafted list object
that is best produced by the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} function. Read that function's
documentation for the lowdown on how to create reactions to above-threshold
failure levels in validation. The basic gist is that you'll want at least a
single threshold level (specified as either the fraction test units failed,
or, an absolute value), often using the \code{warn_at} argument. Using
\code{action_levels(warn_at = 1)} or \code{action_levels(stop_at = 1)} are good choices
depending on the situation (the first produces a warning, the other
\code{stop()}s).

Want to describe this validation step in some detail? Keep in mind that this
is only useful if \code{x} is an \emph{agent}. If that's the case, \code{brief} the agent
with some text that fits. Don't worry if you don't want to do it. The
\emph{autobrief} protocol is kicked in when \code{brief = NULL} and a simple brief will
then be automatically generated.

\examples{

# For all examples here, we'll use
# a simple table with two columns:
# one `integer` (`a`) and the other
# `character` (`b`); the following
# examples will validate that the
# table columns abides match a schema
# object as created by `col_schema()`
tbl <- 
  dplyr::tibble(
    a = 1:5,
    b = letters[1:5]
  )
  
tbl

# Create a column schema object with
# the helper function `col_schema()`
# that describes the columns and
# their types (in the expected order)
schema_obj <- 
  col_schema(
    a = "integer",
    b = "character"
  )
  
# A: Using an `agent` with validation
#    functions and then `interrogate()`

# Validate that the schema object
# `schema_obj` exactly defines
# the column names and column types
agent <-
  create_agent(tbl) \%>\%
  col_schema_match(schema_obj) \%>\%
  interrogate()

# Determine if this validation
# had no failing test units (there is
# a single test unit governed by
# whether there is a match)
all_passed(agent)

# Calling `agent` in the console
# prints the agent's report; but we
# can get a `gt_tbl` object directly
# with `get_agent_report(agent)`

# B: Using the validation function
#    directly on the data (no `agent`)

# This way of using validation functions
# acts as a data filter: data is passed
# through but should `stop()` if there
# is a single test unit failing; the
# behavior of side effects can be
# customized with the `actions` option
tbl \%>\% col_schema_match(schema_obj)

# C: Using the expectation function

# With the `expect_*()` form, we would
# typically perform one validation at a
# time; this is primarily used in
# testthat tests
expect_col_schema_match(tbl, schema_obj)

# D: Using the test function

# With the `test_*()` form, we should
# get a single logical value returned
# to us
tbl \%>\% test_col_schema_match(schema_obj)
