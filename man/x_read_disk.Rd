\arguments{
\item{filename}{The name of a file that was previously written by
\code{\link[=x_write_disk]{x_write_disk()}}.}

\item{path}{An optional path to the file (combined with \code{filename}).}

\item{quiet}{Should the function \emph{not} inform when the file is read? By
default this is \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
An \emph{agent}, \emph{informant}, \emph{multiagent}, or table scan that has been written to
disk (with \code{\link[=x_write_disk]{x_write_disk()}}) can be read back into memory with the
\code{x_read_disk()} function. For an \emph{agent} or an \emph{informant} object that has
been generated in this way, it may not have a data table associated with it
(depending on whether the \code{keep_tbl} option was \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} when
writing to disk) but it should still be able to produce reporting (by
printing the \emph{agent} or \emph{informant} to the console or using
\code{\link[=get_agent_report]{get_agent_report()}}/\code{\link[=get_informant_report]{get_informant_report()}}). An \emph{agent} will return an
x-list with \code{\link[=get_agent_x_list]{get_agent_x_list()}} and yield any available data extracts with
\code{\link[=get_data_extracts]{get_data_extracts()}}. Furthermore, all of an \emph{agent}'s validation steps will
still be present (along with results from the last interrogation).
}
\details{
Should a written-to-disk \emph{agent} or \emph{informant} possess a table-prep formula
or a specific in-memory tablewe could use the \code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}} or
\code{\link[=incorporate]{incorporate()}} function again. For a \emph{data quality reporting} workflow, it
is useful to \code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}} target tables that evolve over time. While the
same validation steps will be used, more can be added before calling
\code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}}. For an \emph{information management} workflow with an \emph{informant}
object, using \code{\link[=incorporate]{incorporate()}} will update aspects of the reporting such as
table dimensions, and info snippets/text will be regenerated.

\section{Examples}{

\subsection{A: Reading an agent from disk}{

The process of developing an agent and writing it to disk with the
\code{\link[=x_write_disk]{x_write_disk()}} function is explained in that function's documentation.
Suppose we have such a written file that's named \code{"agent-small_table.rds"},
we could read that to a new agent object with \code{x_read_disk()}.\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{agent <- x_read_disk("agent-small_table.rds")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\subsection{B: Reading an informant from disk}{

If there is an informant written to disk via \code{\link[=x_write_disk]{x_write_disk()}} and it's named
\code{"informant-small_table.rds"}. We could read that to a new informant object
with \code{x_read_disk()}.\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{informant <- x_read_disk("informant-small_table.rds")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\subsection{C: Reading a multiagent from disk}{

The process of creating a multiagent and writing it to disk with the
\code{\link[=x_write_disk]{x_write_disk()}} function is shown in that function's documentation. Should
we have such a written file called \code{"multiagent-small_table.rds"}, we could
read that to a new multiagent object with \code{x_read_disk()}.\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{multiagent <- x_read_disk("multiagent-small_table.rds")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\subsection{D: Reading a table scan from disk}{

If there is a table scan written to disk via \code{\link[=x_write_disk]{x_write_disk()}} and it's named
\code{"tbl_scan-storms.rds"}, we could read it back into R with \code{x_read_disk()}.\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{tbl_scan <- x_read_disk("tbl_scan-storms.rds")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
