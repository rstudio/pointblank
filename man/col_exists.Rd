\usage{
col_exists(
  x,
  columns,
  actions = NULL,
  step_id = NULL,
  label = NULL,
  brief = NULL,
  active = TRUE
)

expect_col_exists(object, columns, threshold = 1)

test_col_exists(object, columns, threshold = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble (\code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_dbi}), Spark DataFrame
(\code{tbl_spark}), or, an agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent} that is created
with \code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}}.}

\item{columns}{One or more columns from the table in focus. This can be
provided as a vector of column names using \code{c()} or bare column names
enclosed in \code{\link[=vars]{vars()}}.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{step_id}{One or more optional identifiers for the single or multiple
validation steps generated from calling a validation function. The use of
step IDs serves to distinguish validation steps from each other and provide
an opportunity for supplying a more meaningful label compared to the step
index. By default this is \code{NULL}, and \strong{pointblank} will automatically
generate the step ID value (based on the step index) in this case. One or
more values can be provided, and the exact number of ID values should (1)
match the number of validation steps that the validation function call will
produce (influenced by the number of \code{columns} provided), (2) be an ID
string not used in any previous validation step, and (3) be a vector with
unique values.}

\item{label}{An optional label for the validation step. This label appears in
the agent report and for the best appearance it should be kept short.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step. If
nothing is provided here then an \emph{autobrief} is generated by the agent,
using the language provided in \code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}}'s \code{lang} argument (which
defaults to \code{"en"} or English). The \emph{autobrief} incorporates details of the
validation step so it's often the preferred option in most cases (where a
\code{label} might be better suited to succinctly describe the validation).}

\item{active}{A logical value indicating whether the validation step should
be active. If the step function is working with an agent, \code{FALSE} will make
the validation step inactive (still reporting its presence and keeping
indexes for the steps unchanged). If the step function will be operating
directly on data, then any step with \code{active = FALSE} will simply pass the
data through with no validation whatsoever. The default for this is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{object}{A data frame, tibble (\code{tbl_df} or \code{tbl_dbi}), or Spark
DataFrame (\code{tbl_spark}) that serves as the target table for the expectation
function or the test function.}

\item{threshold}{A simple failure threshold value for use with the
expectation (\code{expect_}) and the test (\code{test_}) function variants. By
default, this is set to \code{1} meaning that any single unit of failure in data
validation results in an overall test failure. Whole numbers beyond \code{1}
indicate that any failing units up to that absolute threshold value will
result in a succeeding \strong{testthat} test or evaluate to \code{TRUE}. Likewise,
fractional values (between \code{0} and \code{1}) act as a proportional failure
threshold, where \code{0.15} means that 15 percent of failing test units results
in an overall test failure.}
}
\value{
For the validation function, the return value is either a
\code{ptblank_agent} object or a table object (depending on whether an agent
object or a table was passed to \code{x}). The expectation function invisibly
returns its input but, in the context of testing data, the function is
called primarily for its potential side-effects (e.g., signaling failure).
The test function returns a logical value.
}
\description{
The \code{col_exists()} validation function, the \code{expect_col_exists()} expectation
function, and the \code{test_col_exists()} test function all check whether one or
more columns exist in the target table. The only requirement is specification
of the column names. The validation function can be used directly on a data
table or with an \emph{agent} object (technically, a \code{ptblank_agent} object)
whereas the expectation and test functions can only be used with a data
table. The types of data tables that can be used include data frames,
tibbles, database tables (\code{tbl_dbi}), and Spark DataFrames (\code{tbl_spark}).
Each validation step or expectation will operate over a single test unit,
which is whether the column exists or not.
}
\details{
If providing multiple column names, the result will be an expansion of
validation steps to that number of column names (e.g., \code{vars(col_a, col_b)}
will result in the entry of two validation steps). Aside from column names in
quotes and in \code{vars()}, \strong{tidyselect} helper functions are available for
specifying columns. They are: \code{starts_with()}, \code{ends_with()}, \code{contains()},
\code{matches()}, and \code{everything()}.

Often, we will want to specify \code{actions} for the validation. This argument,
present in every validation function, takes a specially-crafted list object
that is best produced by the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} function. Read that function's
documentation for the lowdown on how to create reactions to above-threshold
failure levels in validation. The basic gist is that you'll want at least a
single threshold level (specified as either the fraction of test units
failed, or, an absolute value), often using the \code{warn_at} argument. Using
\code{action_levels(warn_at = 1)} or \code{action_levels(stop_at = 1)} are good choices
depending on the situation (the first produces a warning, the other
\code{stop()}s).

Want to describe this validation step in some detail? Keep in mind that this
is only useful if \code{x} is an \emph{agent}. If that's the case, \code{brief} the agent
with some text that fits. Don't worry if you don't want to do it. The
\emph{autobrief} protocol is kicked in when \code{brief = NULL} and a simple brief will
then be automatically generated.

\examples{
# For all examples here, we'll use
# a simple table with two columns:
# `a` and `b`
tbl <-
  dplyr::tibble(
    a = c(5, 7, 6, 5, 8, 7),
    b = c(7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3)
  )

# A: Using an `agent` with validation
#    functions and then `interrogate()`

# Validate that columns `a` and `b`
# exist in the `tbl` table; this
# makes two distinct validation
# steps since two columns were
# provided to `vars()`
agent <-
  create_agent(tbl) \%>\%
  col_exists(vars(a, b)) \%>\%
  interrogate()

# Determine if this validation
# had no failing test units (1)
all_passed(agent)

# Calling `agent` in the console
# prints the agent's report; but we
# can get a `gt_tbl` object directly
# with `get_agent_report(agent)`

# B: Using the validation function
#    directly on the data (no `agent`)

# This way of using validation functions
# acts as a data filter: data is passed
# through but should `stop()` if there
# is a single test unit failing; the
# behavior of side effects can be
# customized with the `actions` option
tbl \%>\% col_exists(vars(a, b))

# C: Using the expectation function

# With the `expect_*()` form, we need
# to be more exacting and provide one
# column at a time; this is primarily
# used in testthat tests
expect_col_exists(tbl, vars(a))
expect_col_exists(tbl, vars(b))

# D: Using the test function

# With the `test_*()` form, we should
# get a single logical value returned
# to us (even if there are multiple
# columns tested, as is the case below)
tbl \%>\% test_col_exists(vars(a, b))
