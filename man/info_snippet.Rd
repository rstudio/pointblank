\title{Generate a useful text 'snippet' from the target table}
\usage{
info_snippet(x, snippet_name, fn)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An informant object of class \code{ptblank_informant}.}

\item{snippet_name}{The name for snippet, which is used for interpolating the
snippet itself into info text.}

\item{fn}{A function that obtains a snippet of data from the target table.}
}
\value{
A \code{ptblank_informant} object.
}
\description{
Getting little snippets of information from a table goes hand-in-hand with
mixing those bits of info with your table info. Call \code{info_snippet()} to
define a snippet and how you'll get that from the target table (it's with a
function). So long as you know how to interact with a table and extract
information, you can easily define snippets for a \emph{informant} object. And
once those snippets are defined, you can insert them into the info text as
defined through the \verb{info_*()} functions. Just use curly braces with the
\code{snippet_name} inside (e.g., \code{"This column has {n_cat} categories."}).
