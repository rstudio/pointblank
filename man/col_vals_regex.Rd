\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble, or an agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.}

\item{columns}{The column (or a set of columns, provided as a character
vector) to which this validation should be applied.}

\item{regex}{A regex pattern to test for matching strings.}

\item{na_pass}{Should any encountered \code{NA} values be allowed to pass a
validation unit? This is by default \code{FALSE}. Set to \code{TRUE} to give \code{NA}s
a pass.}

\item{preconditions}{expressions used for mutating the input table before
proceeding with the validation. This is ideally as a one-sided R formula
using a leading \code{~}. In the formula representation, the \code{tbl} serves as the
input data table to be transformed (e.g.,
\code{~ tbl \%>\% dplyr::mutate(col = col + 10)}. A series of expressions can be
used by enclosing the set of statements with \code{{ }} but note that the \code{tbl}
object must be ultimately returned.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}
}
\value{
Either a \code{ptblank_agent} object or a table object, depending on what
was passed to \code{x}.

\description{
The \code{col_vals_regex()} validation step function checks whether column values
(in any number of specified \code{columns}) should correspond to a \code{regex}
matching expression. This function can be used directly on a data table or
with an \emph{agent} object (technically, a \code{ptblank_agent} object). Each
validation step will operate over the number of test units that is equal to
the number of rows in the table (after any \code{preconditions} have been
applied).
}
\details{
If providing multiple column names, the result will be an expansion of
validation steps to that number of column names (e.g., \code{vars(col_a, col_b)}
will result in the entry of two validation steps). Aside from column names
in quotes and in \code{vars()}, \strong{tidyselect} helper functions are available for
specifying columns. They are: \code{starts_with()}, \code{ends_with()}, \code{contains()},
\code{matches()}, \code{one_of()}, and \code{everything()}.

This validation step function supports special handling of \code{NA} values. The
\code{na_pass} argument will determine whether an \code{NA} value appearing in a test
unit should be counted as a \emph{pass} or a \emph{fail}. The default of
\code{na_pass = FALSE} means that any \code{NA}s encountered will accumulate failing
test units.

Often, we will want to specify \code{actions} for the validation. This argument,
present in every validation step function, takes a specially-crafted list
object that is best produced by the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} function. Read that
function's documentation for the lowdown on how to create reactions to
above-threshold failure levels in validation. The basic gist is that you'll
want at least a single threshold level (specified as either the fraction test
units failed, or, an absolute value), often using the \code{warn_at} argument.
This is especially true when \code{x} is a table object because, otherwise,
nothing happens. For the \verb{col_vals_*()}-type functions, using
\code{action_levels(warn_at = 0.25)} or \code{action_levels(stop_at = 0.25)} are good
choices depending on the situation (the first produces a warning when a
quarter of the total test units fails, the other \code{stop()}s at the same
threshold level).

Having table \code{preconditions} means \strong{pointblank} will mutate the table just
before interrogation. It's isolated to the validation steps produced by this
validation step function. Using \strong{dplyr} code is suggested here since the
statements can be translated to SQL if necessary. The code is to be supplied
as a one-sided \strong{R} formula (using a leading \code{~}). In the formula
representation, the obligatory \code{tbl} variable will serve as the input
data table to be transformed (e.g.,
\code{~ tbl \%>\% dplyr::mutate(col_a = col_b + 10)}. A series of expressions can be
used by enclosing the set of statements with \code{{ }} but note that the \code{tbl}
variable must be ultimately returned.

Want to describe this validation step in some detail? Keep in mind that this
is only useful if \code{x} is an \emph{agent}. If that's the case, \code{brief} the agent
with some text that fits. Don't worry if you don't want to do it. The
\emph{autobrief} protocol is kicked in when \code{brief = NULL} and a simple brief will
then be automatically generated.
