\title{Get a table from a local or remote file}
\usage{
file_tbl(file, type = NULL, ..., keep = FALSE, verify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The complete file path leading to a compatible data table either
in the user system or at a \verb{http://}, \verb{https://}, \verb{ftp://}, or \verb{ftps://}
URL. For a file hosted in a GitHub repository, a call to the
\code{\link[=from_github]{from_github()}} function can be used here.}

\item{type}{The file type. This is normally inferred by file extension and is
by default \code{NULL} to indicate that the extension will dictate the type of
file reading that is performed internally. However, if there is no
extension (and valid extensions are \code{.csv}, \code{.tsv}, \code{.rda}, and \code{.rds}), we
can provide the type as either of \code{csv}, \code{tsv}, \code{rda}, or \code{rds}.}

\item{...}{Options passed to \strong{readr}'s \code{read_csv()} or \code{read_tsv()}
function. Both functions have the same arguments and one or the other will
be used internally based on the file extension or an explicit value given
to \code{type}.}

\item{keep}{In the case of a downloaded file, should it be stored in the
working directory (\code{keep = TRUE}) or should it be downloaded to a temporary
directory? By default, this is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verify}{If \code{TRUE} (the default) then a verification of the data object
having the \code{data.frame} class will be carried out.}
}
\value{
A \code{tbl_df} object.
}
\description{
If your target table is in a file, stored either locally or remotely, the
\code{file_tbl()} function can make it possible to access it in a single function
call. Compatible file types for this function are: CSV (\code{.csv}), TSV
(\code{.tsv}), RDA (\code{.rda}), and RDS (\code{.rds}) files. This function generates an
in-memory \code{tbl_dbl} object, which can be used as a target table for
\code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}} and \code{\link[=create_informant]{create_informant()}}. The ideal option for data access
with \code{file_tbl()} is using this function within the \code{tbl} parameter in either
of the aforementioned \verb{create_*()} functions. This can be done by using a
leading \code{~} (e.g,. \code{tbl = ~ file_tbl(...)}).

In the remote data use case, we can specify a URL starting with \verb{http://},
\verb{https://}, etc., and ending with the file containing the data table. If data
files are available in a GitHub repository then we can use the
\code{\link[=from_github]{from_github()}} function to specify the name and location of the table data
in a repository.

\examples{
# A local CSV file can be obtained as
# a tbl object by supplying a path to
# the file and some CSV reading options
# (the ones used by `readr::read_csv()`)
# to the `file_tbl()` function; for
# this example we could obtain a path
# to a CSV file in the pointblank
# package with `system.file()`:
csv_path <- 
  system.file(
    "data_files", "small_table.csv",
    package = "pointblank"
  )

# Then use that path in `file_tbl()`
# with the option to specify the column
# types in that CSV  
tbl <- 
  file_tbl(
    file = csv_path,
    col_types = "TDdcddlc"
  )
  
# Now that we have a `tbl` object that
# is a tibble, it can be introduced to
# `create_agent()` for validation
agent <- create_agent(tbl = tbl)

# A different strategy is to provide
# the data-reading function call
# directly to `create_agent()`:
agent <- 
  create_agent(
    tbl = ~ file_tbl(
      file = system.file(
        "data_files", "small_table.csv",
        package = "pointblank"
      ),
      col_types = "TDdcddlc"
    )
  ) \%>\%
  col_vals_gt(vars(a), value = 0)

# All of the file-reading instructions
# are encapsulated in the `tbl`
# expression so the agent will always
# obtain the most recent version of
# the table (and the logic can be
# translated to YAML, for later use)
