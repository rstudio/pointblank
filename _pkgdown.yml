  - title: Planning and Prep
    desc: >
      Should you need to understand your data a bit more, use the `scan_data()`
      function. It provides a comprehensive report on the data you might be
      planning on validating. If going down the road of preparing a data quality
      analysis, call on an *agent* to carry out that eventual plan with
      `create_agent()`. The agent here is to be told which table is the target,
      and, we devise a stepwise validation plan with validation functions. If
      collecting and publishing table information is your goal, then begin with
      the `create_informant()` function.

  - title: Validation, Expectation, and Test Functions
    desc: >
      Validation steps are either used with an *agent* object or, more simply,
      just with the table of interest. When used with an *agent*, each step
      function called works to build up a validation plan (which is executed
      with the `interrogate()` function). If used directly on data (that is, no
      agent is involved whatsoever), then the data is checked and passed
      through. However, if we (1) set `warn_*` and/or `stop_*` thresholds and
      (2) the level of failed validation units exceeds those set levels, then
      we'll get either a warning or a stop. Each validation step function is
      assoicated with an expectation function (of the form `expect_*()`). These
      expectation functions are equivalent in usage and behavior to those in
      the **testthat** package. Finallly, each validation function has an
      associated test function (of the form `test_*()`) which always returns a
      logical value.

  - title: Information Functions
    desc: >
      We can progressively add information to an *informant* object by using the
      collection of `info_*()` functions. We can add more table-based properties
      with the `info_tabular()` function, details about the nature of each
      column with the `info_columns()` function, and add sections of our own
      choosing (and the info that make sense for those sections) with the
      `info_section()` function. Snippets of information can be gleaned from the
      target table by using the `info_snippet()` function. These bits of
      information can be incorporated in text defined by the other `info_*()`
      functions via `{ }`. Some great `snip_*()` functions are included to make
      info-snipping as easy (and useful!) as can be.

    - info_tabular
    - info_columns
    - info_columns_from_tbl
    - info_section
    - info_snippet

    - snip_stats
    - snip_lowest
    - snip_highest
    
  - title: Emailing
    desc: >
      Sometimes we want to email a report of a validation because of the
      importance of the information contained therein. The `email_blast()`
      function can be used within the `end_fns` argument of `create_agent()`,
      giving us options to send a customizable message only if specified
      conditions are met.
    contents:
    - email_blast
    - email_create
    - stock_msg_body
    - stock_msg_footer
    
  - title: Logging
    desc: >
      Logging validation failure conditions makes for a good practice during
      data quality analysis. The `log4r_step()` function allows for simple
      generation of log entries and specification of logging destinations.
    contents:
    - log4r_step

  - title: "Agent: Interrogate and Report"
    desc: >
      If we have an *agent* object that has a plan (i.e., validation steps),
      the `interrogate()` function instructs the *agent* to interrogate the
      target table. The agent will go to work and also perform specified
      side-effect functions at the step level and upon completion (if those are
      functions are defined). After interrogation, we can get a report through
      printing, however, we can take advantage of more options by using the
      `get_agent_report()` function.
    contents:
    - interrogate
    - get_agent_report
    
  - title: "Informant: Incorporate and Report"
    desc: >
      If we have an *informant* object that has been loaded with information
      from using the `info_*()` functions, the `incorporate()` function works
      to regenerate snippets and integrate those into the info text. After
      refreshing the table information, we can get an information report through
      printing, or, by using `get_informant_report()` function.
    contents:
    - incorporate
    - get_informant_report
    
  - title: Post-interrogation
    desc: >
      The agent always has a special list called an x-list. Access that by
      invoking the `get_agent_x_list()` and you'll then have a smorgasbord of
      information about how the validation went down. Table extracts are
      collected by default for failed rows (up to a limit) and we can access
      those with `get_data_extracts()`. Table rows can be sundered into 'pass'
      and 'fail' pieces. Access those table fragments with the
      `get_sundered_data()` function. Want to know if all validation steps have
      passed with flying colors? Sometimes that could happen; use the
      `all_passed()` function to find out.
    contents:
    - get_agent_x_list
    - get_data_extracts
    - get_sundered_data
    - all_passed
    - write_testthat_file
    
  - title: Object Ops
    desc: >
      We have options for writing an agent or informant to disk with the 
      `x_write_disk()` function. The on-disk object can be retrieved with the
      `x_read_disk()` function. You can export a report as an HTML file with
      `export_report()`. A set of functions are also available for
      managing associations to a data table (either directly or with a
      table-prep formula), and, for editing an agent's validation steps.
    contents:
    - x_write_disk
    - x_read_disk
    - export_report
    - set_tbl
    - activate_steps
    - deactivate_steps
    - remove_steps
    
  - title: The Multiagent
    desc: >
      The multiagent is a group of agents, each tasked with their own
      interrogation to perform. As a group, they provide an interesting and
      informative bit of reporting that tracks the evolution of data quality
      checks over time. With a *multiagent* object, we can get a data quality
      report that handles changes in the target data and matches data validation
      steps across all agent. The predominant application is retrospective
      analysis of data quality for a target table.
    contents:
    - create_multiagent
    - read_disk_multiagent
    - get_multiagent_report
  
  - title: pointblank YAML
    desc: >
      YAML files can be used in **pointblank** for two distinct purposes: (1)
      to define agents and their validation plans, and (2) to define information
      for tables. The `yaml_write()` function allows us write agent and/or
      informant YAML from the namesake objects. We can read them back from disk
      by using the `yaml_read_agent()` and `yaml_read_informant()` functions. As
      a nice shortcut, we can interrogate a table directly from a **pointblank**
      YAML file with `yaml_agent_interrogate()`.
    contents:
    - yaml_write
    - yaml_read_agent
    - yaml_read_informant
    - yaml_agent_interrogate
    - yaml_agent_string
    - yaml_agent_show_exprs
    - yaml_informant_incorporate
    - yaml_exec
    
  - title: Table Transformers
    desc: >
      **Table Transformer** functions can radically transform a data table and
      either provide a wholly different table (like a summary table or table
      properties table) or do some useful filtering in a single step. This can
      be useful for preparing the target table for validation, creating a
      temporary table for a few validation steps, or even as something used
      outside of the **pointblank** workflows. As a nice bonus these
      transformer functions will work equally well with data frames, database
      tables, and Spark tables.
