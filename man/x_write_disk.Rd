\usage{
x_write_disk(
  x,
  filename,
  path = NULL,
  keep_tbl = FALSE,
  keep_extracts = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \emph{agent} object of class \code{ptblank_agent}, an \emph{informant} of class
\code{ptblank_informant}, or an table scan of class \code{ptblank_tbl_scan}.}

\item{filename}{The filename to create on disk for the \code{agent}, \code{informant},
or table scan.}

\item{path}{An optional path to which the file should be saved (this is
automatically combined with \code{filename}).}

\item{keep_tbl}{An option to keep a data table that is associated with the
\emph{agent} or \emph{informant} (which is the case when the \emph{agent}, for example, is
created using \verb{create_agent(tbl = <data table, ...)}). The default is
\code{FALSE} where the data table is removed before writing to disk. For
database tables of the class \code{tbl_dbi} and for Spark DataFrames
(\code{tbl_spark}) the table is always removed (even if \code{keep_tbl} is set to
\code{TRUE}).}

\item{keep_extracts}{An option to keep any collected extract data for failing
rows. Only applies to \emph{agent} objects. By default, this is \code{FALSE} (i.e.,
extract data is removed).}

\item{quiet}{Should the function \emph{not} inform when the file is written? By
default this is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if the file has been written.
}
\description{
Writing an \emph{agent}, \emph{informant}, \emph{multiagent}, or even a table scan to disk
with \code{x_write_disk()} can be useful for keeping data validation intel or
table information close at hand for later retrieval (with \code{\link[=x_read_disk]{x_read_disk()}}).
By default, any data table that the \emph{agent} or \emph{informant} may have held
before being committed to disk will be expunged (not applicable to any table
scan since they never hold a table object). This behavior can be changed by
setting \code{keep_tbl} to \code{TRUE} but this only works in the case where the table
is not of the \code{tbl_dbi} or the \code{tbl_spark} class.
}
\details{
It is recommended to set up a table-prep formula so that the \emph{agent} and
\emph{informant} can access refreshed data after being read from disk through
\code{\link[=x_read_disk]{x_read_disk()}}. This can be done initially with the \code{read_fn} argument of
\code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}}/\code{\link[=create_informant]{create_informant()}} or, later, with \code{\link[=set_read_fn]{set_read_fn()}}.
Alternatively, we can reintroduce the \emph{agent} or \emph{informant} to a data table
with the \code{\link[=set_tbl]{set_tbl()}} function.

# A: Writing an `agent` to disk 

# Let's go through the process of (1)
# developing an agent with a validation
# plan (to be used for the data quality
# analysis of the `small_table` dataset),
# (2) interrogating the agent with the
# `interrogate()` function, and (3) writing
# the agent and all its intel to a file

# Creating an `action_levels` object is a
# common workflow step when creating a
# pointblank agent; we designate failure
# thresholds to the `warn`, `stop`, and
# `notify` states using `action_levels()`
al <- 
  action_levels(
    warn_at = 0.10,
    stop_at = 0.25,
    notify_at = 0.35
  )

# Now create a pointblank `agent` object
# and give it the `al` object (which
# serves as a default for all validation
# steps which can be overridden); the
# data will be referenced in `tbl`
agent <- 
  create_agent(
    tbl = ~ small_table,
    tbl_name = "small_table",
    label = "`x_write_disk()`",
    actions = al
  )

# Then, as with any `agent` object, we
# can add steps to the validation plan by
# using as many validation functions as we
# want; then, we `interrogate()`
agent <-
  agent \%>\% 
  col_exists(vars(date, date_time)) \%>\%
  col_vals_regex(
    vars(b), regex = "[0-9]-[a-z]{3}-[0-9]{3}"

  rows_distinct() \%>\%

  interrogate()

# The `agent` can be written to a file with
# the `x_write_disk()` function
x_write_disk(
  agent,
  filename = "agent-small_table.rds"
)

# We can read the file back as an agent
# with the `x_read_disk()` function and
# we'll get all of the intel along with the
# restored agent

# If you're consistently writing agent
# reports when periodically checking data,
# we could make use of the `affix_date()`
# or `affix_datetime()` depending on the
# granularity you need; here's an example
# that writes the file with the format:
# 'agent-small_table-YYYY-mm-dd_HH-MM-SS.rds'
x_write_disk(
  agent,

# B: Writing an `informant` to disk

# Let's go through the process of (1)
# creating an informant object that
# minimally describes the `small_table`
# dataset, (2) ensuring that data is
# captured from the target table using
# the `incorporate()` function, and (3)
# writing the informant to a file

# Create a pointblank `informant`
# object with `create_informant()`
# and the `small_table` dataset; use
# `incorporate()` so that info snippets
# are integrated into the text

  incorporate()

# The `informant` can be written to a

# this with `affix_date()` so that the
# filename has a datestamp
x_write_disk(
  informant,
  filename = affix_date(
    "informant-small_table.rds"
  )
)

# We can read the file back into a
# new informant object (in the same
# state as when it was saved) by using
# `x_read_disk()`

# C: Writing a multiagent to disk

# Let's create one more pointblank
# agent object, provide it with some
# validation steps, and `interrogate()`
agent_b <-
  create_agent(
    tbl = ~ small_table,
    tbl_name = "small_table",
    label = "`x_write_disk()`",
    actions = al
  ) \%>\%
  col_vals_gt(
    vars(b), vars(g), na_pass = TRUE,
    label = "b > g"
  ) \%>\%
  col_is_character(
    vars(b, f),
    label = "Verifying character-type columns" 
  ) \%>\%
  interrogate()

# Now we can combine the earlier `agent`
# object with the newer `agent_b` to 
# create a `multiagent`
multiagent <-
  create_multiagent(agent, agent_b)
  
# The `multiagent` can be written to
# a file with the `x_write_disk()` function
x_write_disk(
  multiagent,
  filename = "multiagent-small_table.rds"
)

# We can read the file back as a multiagent
# with the `x_read_disk()` function and
# we'll get all of the constituent agents
# and their associated intel back as well

# D: Writing a table scan to disk

# We can get an report that describes all
# of the data in the `storms` dataset
tbl_scan <- scan_data(tbl = dplyr::storms)

# The table scan object can be written
# to a file with `x_write_disk()`
x_write_disk(
  tbl_scan,
  filename = "tbl_scan-storms.rds"
)
