\usage{
action_levels(warn_at = NULL, stop_at = NULL, notify_at = NULL, fns = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{warn_at, stop_at, notify_at}{The threshold number or fraction of
validation units that can provide a \emph{fail} result before entering the
\code{warn}, \code{stop}, or \code{notify} failure states. If this a decimal value between
\code{0} and \code{1} then it's a proportional failure threshold (e.g., \code{0.15}
indicates that if 15\% percent of the validation units are found to \emph{fail},
then the designated failure state is entered). Absolute values starting
from \code{1} can be used instead, and this constitutes an absolute failure
threshold (e.g., \code{10} means that if 10 of the validation units are found to
\emph{fail}, the failure state is entered).}

\item{fns}{A named list of functions that is to be paired with the
appropriate failure states. The syntax for this list involves using failure
state names from the set of \code{warn}, \code{stop}, and \code{notify}. The functions
corresponding to the failure states are provided as formulas (e.g.,
\code{list(warn = ~ warning("Too many failures."))}. A series of expressions for
each named state can be used by enclosing the set of statements with \code{{ }}.}
}
\description{
The \code{action_levels()} function works with the \code{actions} argument that is
present in the \code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}} function and in every validation step
function. With it, we can provide threshold \emph{fail} levels for any combination
of \code{warn}, \code{stop}, or \code{notify} states. We can react to any entrance of a
state by supplying corresponding functions to the \code{fns} argument. They will
undergo evaluation at the time when the matching state is entered. If
provided to \code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}} then the policies will be applied to every
validation step, acting as a default for the validation as a whole. Calls of
\code{action_levels()} could also be applied directly to any validation step and
this will act as an override if set also in \code{\link[=create_agent]{create_agent()}}. Usage of
\code{action_levels()} is required to have any useful side effects (i.e.,
warnings, throwing errors) in the case of validation step functions operating
directly on data.
}
\details{
The output of the \code{action_levels()} call in \code{actions} will be interpreted
slightly differently if using an \emph{agent} or using validation step functions
directly on a data table. For convenience when working directly on data, any
values supplied to \code{warn_at} or \code{stop_at} will be automatically given a stock
\code{warning()} or \code{stop()} function. If you were to supply those manually then
the stock functions would be overridden. Furthermore, if \code{actions} is NULL in
this workflow, \strong{pointblank} will use a \code{warn_at} value of \code{1} (providing a
warning if there are any \emph{fail} units). We can absolutely suppress this
automatic warning behavior by at each validation step by setting \code{active = FALSE}. In this interactive data case there is no stock function given for
the \code{notify_at}. The \code{notify} failure state is less commonly used in this
workflow as it is in the \emph{agent}-based one.

When using an \emph{agent}, we often opt to not use any functions in \code{fns} as the
\code{warn}, \code{stop}, and \code{notify} failure states will be reported on when using
\code{create_agent_report()} (and, usually that's sufficient).
