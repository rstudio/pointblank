With the **pointblank** package it’s really easy to methodically
validate your data whether in the form of data frames or as database
tables. On top of the validation toolset, the package gives you the
means to provide and keep up-to-date with the information that *defines*
your tables.

For table *validation*, the *agent* object works with a large collection
of simple (yet powerful!) validation functions. We can enable much more
sophisticated validation checks by using custom expressions, segmenting
the data, and by selective mutations of the target table. The suite of
validation functions ensures that *everything just works* no matter
whether your table is a data frame or a database table.

Sometimes, we want to maintain table *information* and update it when
the table goes through changes. For that, we can use an *informant*
object plus associated functions to help define the metadata entries and
present it as a data dictionary. Just like we can with validation,
**pointblank** offers easy ways to have the metadata updated so that
this important documentation doesn’t become stale.

## TABLE VALIDATIONS WITH AN AGENT AND DATA QUALITY REPORTING

Data validation can be carried out in *Data Quality Reporting* workflow,
ultimately resulting in the production of a data quality analysis
report. This is most useful in a non-interactive mode where data quality
for database tables and on-disk data files must be periodically checked.
The **pointblank** *agent* is given a collection of validation functions
to define validation steps. We can get extracts of data rows that failed
validation, set up custom functions that are invoked by exceeding set
threshold failure rates, etc. Want to email the report regularly (or,
only if certain conditions are met)? Yep, you can do all that.

Here is an example of how to use **pointblank** to validate a local
table with an *agent*.

``` r
# Generate a simple `action_levels` object to
# set the `warn` state if a validation step
# has a single 'fail' test unit
al <- action_levels(warn_at = 1)

# Create a pointblank `agent` object, with the
# tibble as the target table. Use three validation
# functions, then, `interrogate()`. The agent will
# then have some useful intel.
agent <- 
  dplyr::tibble(
    a = c(5, 7, 6, 5, NA, 7),
    b = c(6, 1, 0, 6,  0, 7)
  ) %>%
  create_agent(
    label = "A very *simple* example.",
    actions = al
  ) %>%
  col_vals_between(
    columns = a,
    left = 1,
    right = 9,
    na_pass = TRUE
  ) %>%
  col_vals_lt(
    columns = c, 12,
    preconditions = ~ . %>% dplyr::mutate(c = a + b)
  ) %>%
  col_is_numeric(columns = c(a, b)) %>%
  interrogate()
```

The reporting’s pretty sweet. We can get a **gt**-based report by
printing an *agent*.

![](reference/figures/agent_report.png)

The **pointblank** package is designed to be both straightforward yet
powerful. And fast! Local data frames don’t take very long to validate
extensively and all validation checks on remote tables are done entirely
in-database. So we can add dozens or even hundreds of validation steps
without any long waits for reporting.

Should you want to perform validation checks on database or *Spark*
tables, provide a `tbl_dbi` or `tbl_spark` object to
[`create_agent()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/create_agent.md).
The **pointblank** package currently supports *PostgreSQL*. *MySQL*,
*MariaDB*, *Microsoft SQL Server*, *Google BigQuery*, *DuckDB*,
*SQLite*, and *Spark DataFrames* (through the **sparklyr** package).

Here are some validation reports for the considerably larger
`intendo::intendo_revenue` table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](reference/figures/pipeline_data_validation_workflow.svg)

## VALIDATIONS DIRECTLY ON DATA

The *Pipeline Data Validation* workflow uses the same collection of
validation functions but without need of an *agent*. This is useful for
an ETL process where we want to periodically check data and trigger
warnings, raise errors, or write out logs when exceeding specified
failure thresholds. It’s a cinch to perform checks on import of the data
and at key points during the transformation process, perhaps stopping
data flow if things are unacceptable with regard to data quality.

The following example uses the same three validation functions as before
but, this time, we use them directly on the data. The validation
functions act as a filter, passing data through unless execution is
stopped by failing validations beyond the set threshold. In this
workflow, by default, an error will occur if there is a single ‘fail’
test unit in any validation step:

``` r
dplyr::tibble(
    a = c(5, 7, 6, 5, NA, 7),
    b = c(6, 1, 0, 6,  0, 7)
  ) %>%
  col_vals_between(
    columns = a,
    left = 1,
    right = 9,
    na_pass = TRUE
  ) %>%
  col_vals_lt(
    columns = c,
    value = 12,
    preconditions = ~ . %>% dplyr::mutate(c = a + b)
  ) %>%
  col_is_numeric(columns = c(a, b))
```

``` R
Error: Exceedance of failed test units where values in `c` should have been < `12`.
The `col_vals_lt()` validation failed beyond the absolute threshold level (1).
* failure level (2) >= failure threshold (1) 
```

We can downgrade this error to a warning with the
[`warn_on_fail()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/action_levels.md)
helper function (assigning it to `actions`). In this way, the data will
always be returned, but warnings will appear.

``` r
# The `warn_on_fail()` function is a nice
# shortcut for `action_levels(warn_at = 1)`;
# it works great in this data checking workflow
# (and the threshold can still be adjusted)
dplyr::tibble(
    a = c(5, 7, 6, 5, NA, 7),
    b = c(6, 1, 0, 6,  0, 7)
  ) %>%
  col_vals_between(
    columns = a,
    left = 1,
    right = 9,
    na_pass = TRUE,
    actions = warn_on_fail()
  ) %>%
  col_vals_lt(
    columns = c,
    value = 12,
    preconditions = ~ . %>% dplyr::mutate(c = a + b),
    actions = warn_on_fail()
  ) %>%
  col_is_numeric(
    columns = c(a, b),
    actions = warn_on_fail()
  )
```

``` R
#> # A tibble: 6 x 2
#>       a     b
#>   <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1     5     6
#> 2     7     1
#> 3     6     0
#> 4     5     6
#> 5    NA     0
#> 6     7     7

Warning message:
Exceedance of failed test units where values in `c` should have been < `12`.
The `col_vals_lt()` validation failed beyond the absolute threshold level (1).
* failure level (2) >= failure threshold (1) 
```

Should you need more fine-grained thresholds and resultant actions, the
[`action_levels()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/action_levels.md)
function can be used to specify multiple failure thresholds and side
effects for each failure state. However, with
[`warn_on_fail()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/action_levels.md)
and
[`stop_on_fail()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/action_levels.md)
(applied by default, with `stop_at = 1`), you should have good enough
options for this validation workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## TABLE INFORMATION

Table information can be synthesized in an *information management*
workflow, giving us a snapshot of a data table we care to collect
information on. The **pointblank** *informant* is fed a series of
`info_*()` functions to define bits of information about a table. This
info text can pertain to individual columns, the table as a whole, and
whatever additional information makes sense for your organization. We
can even glean little snippets of information (like column stats or
sample values) from the target table with
[`info_snippet()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/info_snippet.md)
and the `snip_*()` functions and mix them into the data dictionary
wherever they’re needed.

Here is an example of how to use **pointblank** to incorporate pieces of
info text into an *informant* object.

``` r
# Create a pointblank `informant` object, with the
# tibble as the target table. Use a few information
# functions and end with `incorporate()`. The informant
# will then show you information about the tibble.
informant <- 
  dplyr::tibble(
    a = c(5, 7, 6, 5, NA, 7),
    b = c(6, 1, 0, 6,  0, 7)
  ) %>%
  create_informant(
    label = "A very *simple* example.",
    tbl_name = "example_tbl"
  ) %>%
  info_tabular(
    description = "This two-column table is nothing all that
    interesting, but, it's fine for examples on **GitHub**
    `README` pages. Column names are `a` and `b`. ((Cool stuff))"
  ) %>%
  info_columns(
    columns = a,
    info = "This column has an `NA` value. [[Watch out!]]<<color: red;>>"
  ) %>%
  info_columns(
    columns = a,
    info = "Mean value is `{a_mean}`."
  ) %>%
  info_columns(
    columns = b,
    info = "Like column `a`. The lowest value is `{b_lowest}`."
  ) %>%
  info_columns(
    columns = b,
    info = "The highest value is `{b_highest}`."
  ) %>%
  info_snippet(
    snippet_name = "a_mean",
    fn = ~ . %>% .$a %>% mean(na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(2)
  ) %>%
  info_snippet(snippet_name = "b_lowest", fn = snip_lowest("b")) %>%
  info_snippet(snippet_name = "b_highest", fn = snip_highest("b")) %>%
  info_section(
    section_name = "further information", 
    `examples and documentation` = "Examples for how to use the
    `info_*()` functions (and many more) are available at the
    [**pointblank** site](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/)."
  ) %>%
  incorporate()
```

By printing the *informant* we get the table information report.

Here is a link to a hosted information report for the
`intendo::intendo_revenue` table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## TABLE SCANS

We can use the
[`scan_data()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/scan_data.md)
function to generate a comprehensive summary of a tabular dataset. This
allows us to quickly understand what’s in the dataset and it helps us
determine if there are any peculiarities within the data. Scanning the
[`dplyr::storms`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/storms.html)
dataset with `scan_data(tbl = dplyr::storms)` gives us an interactive
HTML report. Here are a few of them, published in **RPubs**:

[![Table Scan of
dplyr::storms](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Table%20Scan&message=dplyr::storms&color=blue)](https://rpubs.com/rich_i/scan_data_storms)

pointblank::game_revenue](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Table%20Scan&message=pointblank::game_revenue&color=blue)](https://rpubs.com/rich_i/scan_data_game_revenue)

Database tables can be used with
[`scan_data()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/scan_data.md)
as well. Here are two examples using (1) the `full_region` table of the
**Rfam** database (hosted publicly at `mysql-rfam-public.ebi.ac.uk`) and
(2) the `assembly` table of the **Ensembl** database (hosted publicly at
`ensembldb.ensembl.org`).

## Planning and Prep

Should you need to understand your data a bit more, use the
[`scan_data()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/scan_data.md)
function. It provides a comprehensive report on the data you might be
planning on validating. If going down the road of preparing a data
quality analysis, call on an *agent* to carry out that eventual plan
with
[`create_agent()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/create_agent.md).
The agent here is to be told which table is the target, and, we devise a
stepwise validation plan with validation functions. If collecting and
publishing table information is your goal, then begin with the
[`create_informant()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/create_informant.md)
function.

## Validation, Expectation, and Test Functions

Validation functions are either used with an *agent* object or, more
simply, just with the table of interest. When used with an *agent*, each
validation works to build up a validation plan (which is executed with
the
[`interrogate()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/interrogate.md)
function). If one or more validation functions are used directly on data
(that is, no agent is involved whatsoever), then the data is checked and
passed through if there are no problems. We can fine tune the `warn_*`
and/or `stop_*` thresholds and so that if the level of failed validation
units exceeds those set levels, then we’ll get either a warning or an
error. Each validation function is associated with an expectation
function (of the form `expect_*()`). These expectation functions are
equivalent in usage and behavior to those in the **testthat** package.
Finally, each validation function has an associated test function (of
the form `test_*()`) that always returns a logical value.

## Information Functions

We can progressively add information to an *informant* object by using
the collection of `info_*()` functions. We can add more table-based
properties with the
[`info_tabular()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/info_tabular.md)
function, details about the nature of each column with the
[`info_columns()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/info_columns.md)
function, and add sections of our own choosing (and the info that make
sense for those sections) with the
[`info_section()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/info_section.md)
function. Snippets of information can be gleaned from the target table
by using the
[`info_snippet()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/info_snippet.md)
function. These bits of information can be incorporated in text defined
by the other `info_*()` functions via
[`{ }`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Paren.html). Some great `snip_*()`
functions are included to make info-snipping as easy (and useful!) as
can be.

## Emailing

Sometimes we want to email a report of a validation because of the
importance of the information contained therein. The
[`email_blast()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/email_blast.md)
function can be used within the `end_fns` argument of
[`create_agent()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/create_agent.md),
giving us options to send a customizable message only if specified
conditions are met.

  : Provide simple email message body components: footer

## Logging

Logging validation failure conditions makes for a good practice during
data quality analysis. The
[`log4r_step()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/log4r_step.md)
function allows for simple generation of log entries and specification
of logging destinations.

- [![](icons/log4r_step.png)](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/log4r_step.md)
  [`log4r_step()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/log4r_step.md)
  : Enable logging of failure conditions at the validation step level

## Agent: Interrogate and Report

If we have an *agent* object that has a plan (i.e., validation steps),
the
[`interrogate()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/interrogate.md)
function instructs the *agent* to interrogate the target table. The
agent will go to work and also perform specified side-effect functions
at the step level and upon completion (if those are functions are
defined). After interrogation, we can get a report through printing,
however, we can take advantage of more options by using the
[`get_agent_report()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_agent_report.md)
function.

  : Get a summary report from an agent

## Informant: Incorporate and Report

If we have an *informant* object that has been loaded with information
from using the `info_*()` functions, the
[`incorporate()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/incorporate.md)
function works to regenerate snippets and integrate those into the info
text. After refreshing the table information, we can get an information
report through printing, or, by using
[`get_informant_report()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_informant_report.md)
function.

- [![](icons/incorporate.png)](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/incorporate.md)

  [`get_informant_report()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_informant_report.md)
  :

## Post-interrogation

The agent always has a special list called an x-list. Access that by
invoking the
[`get_agent_x_list()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_agent_x_list.md)
and you’ll then have a smorgasbord of information about how the
validation went down. Table extracts are collected by default for failed
rows (up to a limit) and we can access those with
[`get_data_extracts()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_data_extracts.md).
Table rows can be sundered into ‘pass’ and ‘fail’ pieces. Access those
table fragments with the
[`get_sundered_data()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_sundered_data.md)
function. Want to know if all validation steps have passed with flying
colors? Sometimes that could happen; use the
[`all_passed()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/all_passed.md)
function to find out.

  :

## Object Ops

We have options for writing an agent or informant to disk with the
[`x_write_disk()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/x_write_disk.md)
function. The on-disk object can be retrieved with the
[`x_read_disk()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/x_read_disk.md)
function. You can export a report as an HTML file with
[`export_report()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/export_report.md).
A set of functions are also available for setting a data table to an
existing object, and, for editing an agent’s validation steps.

- [![](icons/x_write_disk.png)](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/x_write_disk.md)

## The Multiagent

The *multiagent* is a group of agents, all bundled together into a
single object. With this grouping, we can generate unified reporting
across the component agents with the
[`get_multiagent_report()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_multiagent_report.md)
function. One style of reporting (`"long"`) provides a serial listing of
agent reports. The other option (`"wide"`) is useful for tracking the
evolution of data quality checks over time since common steps across all
interrogations will form individual rows (and each interrogation will
form a column).

- [![](icons/create_multiagent.png)](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/create_multiagent.md)

  : Get a summary report using multiple agents

## pointblank YAML

YAML files can be used in **pointblank** for two distinct purposes: (1)
to define agents and their validation plans, and (2) to define
information for tables. The
[`yaml_write()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/yaml_write.md)
function allows us write agent or informant YAML from the namesake
objects. We can read them back from disk by using the
[`yaml_read_agent()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/yaml_read_agent.md)
and
[`yaml_read_informant()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/yaml_read_informant.md)
functions. As a nice shortcut, we read *agent* YAML and interrogate
immediately with
[`yaml_agent_interrogate()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/yaml_agent_interrogate.md);
in a similar manner, we can read *informant* YAML and incorporate table
information with
[`yaml_informant_incorporate()`](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/reference/yaml_informant_incorporate.md).

## Table Transformers

**Table Transformer** functions can radically transform a data table and
either provide a wholly different table (like a summary table or table
properties table) or do some useful filtering in a single step. This can
be useful for preparing the target table for validation, creating a
temporary table for a few validation steps, or even as something used
outside of the **pointblank** workflows. As a nice bonus these
transformer functions will work equally well with data frames, database
tables, and Spark tables.
