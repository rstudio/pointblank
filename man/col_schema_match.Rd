\usage{
col_schema_match(x, schema, actions = NULL, brief = NULL, active = TRUE)

expect_col_schema_match(object, schema, threshold = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, tibble, or an agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.
This is to be used as the main input for a validation step function.}

\item{schema}{A table schema of type \code{col_schema} which can be generated
using the \code{\link[=col_schema]{col_schema()}} function.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}

\item{active}{A logical value indicating whether the validation step should
be active. If the step function is working with an agent, \code{FALSE} will make
the validation step inactive (still reporting its presence and keeping
indexes for the steps unchanged). If the step function will be operating
directly on data, then any step with \code{active = FALSE} will simply pass the
data through with no validation whatsoever. The default for this is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{object}{A data frame or a tibble. This is to be used expressly as input
for a testthat expectation function (which are all in the form
\verb{expect_*()}).}

\item{threshold}{A simple failure threshold value for use with the testthat
expectation function. By default, this is set to \code{1} meaning that any
single unit of failure in data validation results in an overall test
failure. Whole numbers beyond \code{1} indicate that any failing units up to
that absolute threshold value will result in a succeeding testthat test.
Likewise, fractional values (between \code{0} and \code{1}) act as a proportional
failure threshold.}
}
\value{
For the validation step function, the return value is either a
\code{ptblank_agent} object or a table object (depending on whether an agent
object or a table was passed to \code{x}). The expectation function invisibly
returns its input but, in the context of testing data, the function is
called primarily for its potential side-effects (e.g., signaling failure).
}
\description{
The \code{col_schema_match()} validation step function works in conjunction with a
\code{col_schema} object (generated through the \code{\link[=col_schema]{col_schema()}} function) to
determine whether the expected schema matches the target table. This
validation step operates over a single test unit, which is whether the schema
exactly matches that of the table. If the target table is a \code{tbl_sql} object,
we can choose to validate the column schema that is based on R column types
(e.g., \code{"numeric"}, \code{"character"}, etc.), or, SQL column types (e.g.,
\code{"double"}, \code{"varchar"}, etc.). That option is defined in the \code{\link[=col_schema]{col_schema()}}
function (with the \code{.db_col_types} argument).
}
\details{
Often, we will want to specify \code{actions} for the validation. This argument,
present in every validation step function, takes a specially-crafted list
object that is best produced by the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} function. Read that
function's documentation for the lowdown on how to create reactions to
above-threshold failure levels in validation. The basic gist is that you'll
want at least a single threshold level (specified as either the fraction test
units failed, or, an absolute value), often using the \code{warn_at} argument.
Using \code{action_levels(warn_at = 1)} or \code{action_levels(stop_at = 1)} are good
choices depending on the situation (the first produces a warning, the other
\code{stop()}s).

Want to describe this validation step in some detail? Keep in mind that this
is only useful if \code{x} is an \emph{agent}. If that's the case, \code{brief} the agent
with some text that fits. Don't worry if you don't want to do it. The
\emph{autobrief} protocol is kicked in when \code{brief = NULL} and a simple brief will
then be automatically generated.
